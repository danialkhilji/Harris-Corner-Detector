# Harris-Corner-Detector
This project detects the corners in the image using Harris Corner Detector algorithm implemented in python.
The project also tests the effects of rotation and scaling on the number of corners detected in the image.
The input images are named image1 and image 2.
The results folder consists of all the resulting images showing all the corners in each image.
Further details and explanation of every bit of the algorithm is explained in the report file.
